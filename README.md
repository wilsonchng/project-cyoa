KNOX OUTBREAK is an text-based Choose-Your-Own-Adventure game inspired by the popular [Project Zomboid](https://projectzomboid.com/blog/) by The Indie Stone. You play as a lone survivor during the initial days of zombie outbreak in the fictional setting of Knox county, Kentucky USA. Fight zombies, flee the horde, and scavenge enough supplies for the journey to Louisville, where the promise of salvation awaits those not affected by the virus.

This is a mini project for prototyping a text based game and only the first chapter is complete. You may play the game here: https://wilsonchng.github.io/project-cyoa/
